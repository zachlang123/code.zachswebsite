I am an Assistant Professor of Political Science at Anderson University. Before moving to South Carolina, I received my Ph.D. from the University of Missouri where I was also a PhD fellow at the Kinder Institute on Constitutional Democracy. My subfields are American politics and public policy. There are two veins of my research: one that focusses on The Constitution, federalism, and state politics, and one that focusses on political science education.

You can download a copy of my Curriculum Vitae {{< staticref "Lang_CV.pdf" "newtab" >}}here{{< /staticref >}}.

I was born and raised in the “Hereford Zone,” a rural, agriculture-heavy area outside of Baltimore, Maryland. I was interested in social studies and teaching from a young age. When I’m not prepping for classes or doing research, you can usually find me out running, out with friends, or inside playing through a new video game…a good day is a combination of all three.
