I am an incoming Assistant Professor of Political Science at Anderson University. Before moving to South Carolina, I received my Ph.D. from the University of Missouri where I was also a fellow at the Kinder Institute on Constitutional Democracy. My subfields are American politics and public policy. My research interests focus on federalism and state politics, and political science education.

You can download a copy of my Curriculum Vitae {{< staticref "Lang_CV.pdf" "newtab" >}}here{{< /staticref >}}.

I was born and raised in the “Hereford Zone,” a rural, agriculture-heavy area outside of Baltimore, Maryland. I was interested in social studies and teaching from a young age. When I’m not working on my dissertation, you can usually find me out running, out with friends, or inside playing through a new video game…a good day is a combination of all three.
