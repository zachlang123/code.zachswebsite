I am a political science PhD candidate at the [Harry S Truman School of Government & Public Affairs](https://truman.missouri.edu) at the University of Missouri and a graduate fellow at the [Kinder Institute on Constitutional Democracy](https://democracy.missouri.edu/). Before moving to Missouri, I received my BA in Government from St. Lawrence University in upstate New York. My subfields are American politics and public policy. My research interests span both American political institutions and political behavior within the study of federalism and constitutionalism. My dissertation examines the rise in multistate litigation against the Federal Government in recent decades and focusses particularly on the political and institutional factors surrounding state attorneys general and their role in this growing phenomenon.

You can download a copy of my Curriculum Vitae {{< staticref "Lang_CV.pdf" "newtab" >}}here{{< /staticref >}}.

I was born and raised in the “Hereford Zone,” a rural, community-oriented, agriculture-heavy area outside of Baltimore, Maryland. I was interested in social studies and teaching from a young age. When I’m not working on my dissertation, you can usually find me out running, out with friends, or inside playing through a new video game…a good day is a combination of all three.
